Excellent question, Vaibhav — and it’s a smart one because *how you handle what you don’t know* is a **huge part of what clients notice** in interviews (especially for roles where communication is key).

Here’s exactly how to handle it confidently 👇

---

## 🎯 **If You Don’t Know the Answer — The Right Way to Respond**

### ✅ Step 1: Stay calm and composed

Don’t show panic or hesitation — smile lightly and take a breath.

> ❌ Don’t say: “Uh… I don’t know.”
> ✅ Say instead:
> “That’s a good question — I haven’t worked directly with that, but I can share how I’d approach it.”

---

### ✅ Step 2: Use one of these **professional fallback phrases**

**Option 1 – Show curiosity**

> “That’s an interesting question. I haven’t implemented that myself yet, but I’d be keen to explore how it works.”

**Option 2 – Show logical thinking**

> “I haven’t faced that exact situation, but based on my understanding of Node.js, I’d probably start by [explain your thought process briefly].”

**Option 3 – Admit it clearly but positively**

> “I haven’t come across that particular concept yet, but I’m confident I could pick it up quickly if needed.”

**Option 4 – Redirect to what you know**

> “I haven’t used that library directly, but I’ve worked with similar tools like [X or Y], so I understand the overall concept.”

---

### ✅ Step 3: If you truly have no idea

> “That’s something I haven’t explored yet, but I’ll definitely look it up after this interview — it sounds interesting.”

(This shows humility *and* initiative — clients love that.)

## 💬 **Example Scenarios**

**Q:** “Have you worked with AWS Lambda?”
**A:**

> “I haven’t used Lambda specifically, but I have experience deploying Node.js apps on cloud environments. I understand how serverless functions work conceptually, and I’d be comfortable learning AWS Lambda if needed.”

---

**Q:** “What’s the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate() in Node.js?”
**A:**

> “That’s a detailed one — I haven’t gone deep into those methods recently, but I know both are related to event loop timing. I’d need to brush up on the exact difference.”

(→ calm, honest, professional — not a problem at all.)

### ✅ **Bonus Tip**

If they explain it after your answer, you can end with:

> “Ah, got it. Thanks for clarifying — that makes sense.”

That tiny line shows professionalism and humility.

### ⚡ **Golden Rule**

👉 It’s **not about knowing everything** — it’s about showing:

* **Confidence**
* **Honesty**
* **Logical thinking**
* **Willingness to learn**

That’s what impresses clients the most, especially in short international interviews.
