## Q1. “Tell me about yourself and why you’re interested in joining Delightree.”

I’m Vaibhav Raj. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and I have about four years of experience building and maintaining backend systems. I work mainly with Node.js, Express, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

I started my career at KnowledgeHut, which later merged with UpGrad, and then moved to Convergetech. This gave me exposure to both product and service environments, and helped me develop a strong sense of ownership. In my current role, I’ve handled features end-to-end and focused heavily on keeping the product stable.

I’m interested in Delightree because it’s solving a very real problem for multi-location businesses, and I connect with that mission. I’m looking for a place where I can contribute directly, take responsibility, and grow with the product. And I’m comfortable working independently during US hours and keeping things stable when the rest of the team is offline.”



## Q2. “How do you handle urgent production issues?”

For any production issue, I start by understanding the scope — whether it affects a single tenant or multiple tenants. That tells me how urgent and how wide the impact is.

Then I check the logs, events, and payloads to reproduce the issue as closely as possible. Once I can reproduce it, I narrow it down to whether the problem is in the code, configuration, or the architecture.

If it’s a code-level issue, I fix it immediately and test it with the same payload that caused the error. If it’s something architectural, I apply the safest temporary fix to stabilize the system, and then I document it and discuss the long-term solution with the team during handoff.

Throughout the process, I keep communication clear — what happened, what I found, what I’m doing, and the ETA.


## Q3. “How do you communicate when you’re working remotely and most of the team is offline?”

During US hours, I keep my communication very clear and structured since most of the team is offline.
I document everything — what happened, what I checked, what I found, and what’s still pending — so anyone can pick it up without confusion.

My handover notes include logs, payloads, and steps to reproduce, which keeps continuity smooth across time zones.
Overall, I stay proactive, transparent, and easy to follow.

## Q4. “Tell me about a time you took ownership of a problem.”

Recently, we had a production issue related to payments. As soon as I got the alert, I started by identifying the scope — which tenant it affected and which payment gateway was involved.

I checked the logs and used the same payload to reproduce the issue. The error message showed that the payment was being declined by the gateway, which told me it wasn’t a code bug. It looked more like a credential or configuration problem.

I verified the credentials on our side and found that the client’s keys were invalid, possibly due to a rotation or incomplete KYC. I communicated this clearly to the client, explained what needed to be fixed, and guided them through the steps. Once they completed their KYC and updated the keys, the issue was resolved immediately.

After that, I documented the entire incident and added a checklist to prevent similar issues in the future. I took the problem end-to-end — from investigation to resolution to prevention.

## Q5. “What does ownership mean to you?”

For me, ownership means taking responsibility end-to-end.
It starts with understanding the problem clearly, then finding the right solution instead of just patching symptoms. If a quick fix is needed to stabilize things, I do it — but I always follow up with a proper long-term fix.

It also means documenting the issue, the root cause, and the final solution so the same problem doesn’t repeat. And throughout the process, I keep communication clear — keeping my manager or client updated so everyone knows the status.

Ownership, to me, is not waiting for someone to tell me what to do. It’s taking charge, solving the problem, and making sure it stays solved.

## Q6. “How do you handle a situation when you don’t know the solution?”

If I don’t know the solution, I don’t panic and I don’t guess.
I start by breaking the problem down — checking logs, reproducing the issue, and understanding what’s actually happening. I use documentation, past incidents, and code history to narrow it down.

If I still don’t have the answer, I look for the fastest, most reliable way to figure it out — like checking the service behaviour, API references, or running small tests.

And if the issue is still unclear and could impact customers, I communicate that early instead of waiting too long. I explain what I’ve done, what I’m trying next, and what support I might need.

For me, not knowing the solution is normal — what matters is staying calm, being systematic, and making progress instead of getting stuck.

## Q7. “How do you prioritize tasks when everything feels urgent?”
I always start by checking the scope and impact.
If an issue affects multiple tenants or blocks core functionality, that becomes my first priority. If it affects only one tenant and has a workaround, it comes next.

I also look at the risk — anything that could cause data loss, payment failures, or downtime gets handled immediately.

After that, I sequence the remaining tasks based on urgency, effort, and dependencies. And throughout the process, I keep communication clear so everyone knows what I’m focusing on and why.

This way I’m not just reacting — I’m prioritizing based on real impact.

## Q8. “Why should we hire you for this role?”

You should hire me because I bring the two things this role needs the most — strong backend problem-solving and real ownership.

I’ve spent the last four years working on Node.js, Express, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB, and I’ve handled production issues end-to-end in real-time. I know how to debug fast, find the root cause, and keep systems stable.

I’m also comfortable working independently during US hours. When the rest of the team is offline, you can trust that I’ll investigate issues properly, communicate clearly, and keep the product running smoothly.

I don’t wait for instructions — I take responsibility, solve the problem, and make sure it doesn’t happen again. That’s the mindset I’ll bring to Delightree.

## Q9. “What motivates you?”

I’m motivated by solving real problems and seeing the impact of my work.
When something is broken in production and I can fix it, stabilize it, and make sure it doesn’t happen again — that gives me real satisfaction.

I also enjoy continuous learning. Backend work changes fast, and I like improving my debugging, architecture understanding, and system thinking.

And finally, I’m motivated by ownership. When I know a system is depending on me — I naturally push myself to do my best and keep things running smoothly

## Q10. “How do you work with cross-functional teams like frontend, QA, or customer success?”

I work with cross-functional teams by keeping communication simple, clear, and focused on the outcome.

When I’m working with frontend or QA, I make sure we are aligned on the expected behaviour, edge cases, and testing steps. I avoid long technical explanations unless they ask — I give only what they need to move fast.

With customer success or non-technical teams, I explain issues in plain language: what happened, why it happened, and what the impact is. I don’t overload them with technical details — I focus on clarity and timelines.

Overall, I try to be someone who makes their work easier, not harder. My goal is always collaboration, not confusion

## Q11. What do you expect from your team or manager?

don’t expect much from my manager—just clarity of direction and open communication.
Once I know the priorities and the goals, I’m comfortable taking ownership and working independently.

I also appreciate honest feedback. If something can be improved, I prefer hearing it directly so I can fix it fast.

From my team, I only expect collaboration and transparency. If we keep communication clear and respect each other’s time, everything else becomes smooth.

## Q12. “Why do you want to work in a startup / fast-paced environment?”

I enjoy fast-paced environments because they give me real ownership and meaningful work. In a startup, the impact of what I do is visible immediately — if I fix something or improve something, the whole product and customers feel it.

I also like that startups move quickly. There’s less bureaucracy, decisions happen faster, and I get to work across different parts of the system instead of being stuck in a small box. That helps me grow much faster as an engineer.

Most importantly, I like solving real problems, not just following tickets. A fast-moving environment gives me the freedom to think, take responsibility, and contribute directly to the success of the product. That motivates me a lot.

## Q13. “What do you do if multiple people ask for help at the same time?”

If multiple people ask for help at the same time, I don’t react emotionally — I prioritize logically.
First, I check which issue has the biggest impact: anything affecting production, multiple tenants, or revenue gets handled first. After that, I look at urgency, risk, and whether there’s a quick workaround for the others.

I also communicate clearly to everyone involved. I let them know what I’m working on, why it’s the priority, and when I’ll get to the rest. This removes confusion and sets the right expectations.

My goal is to stay calm, avoid splitting my focus, and handle each issue properly instead of rushing through everything at once.

## Q14. What kind of work environment brings out your best performance?

I perform best in an environment that values clarity, ownership, and open communication.
Once the priorities are clear, I like having the freedom to take responsibility, investigate issues, and deliver results without being micro-managed.

I also work very well in teams where people are direct and transparent. If something needs to be improved, I appreciate honest feedback — it helps me move faster.

And because I’ll be working US hours, I do best in environments where documentation and handovers are important. That makes collaboration smooth, even across time zones.

Overall, I thrive in a place where the focus is on solving real problems, moving quickly, and supporting each other.

## Q15. What is your biggest strength?

My biggest strength is that I stay self-motivated and always push myself to solve problems fully. I can clearly visualize how the backend system behaves in real time — how the data flows, where it might break, and what the real root cause is.
This helps me debug faster, avoid quick temporary fixes, and stay reliable even when working independently.

## Q16. Do you have any weaknesses?

One weakness I have is that even after I fix an issue or finish a feature, my mind keeps going back to it. I keep thinking about how I could make it better or more efficient. It comes from wanting to do things really well. 
I’m learning to balance that by finishing what’s needed first and then improving things later when there’s time.

## Q17. Tell us about a conflict or disagreement and how you resolved it.
In my previous company, I had a disagreement with my team lead about an API that generated certificates. The API was slow because we were returning the certificate as a Base64 string in the response.

I suggested storing the certificate in S3 instead and returning only the S3 link. To avoid opinions, I tested both approaches and showed him the performance difference — the S3 approach was much faster and reduced API load.

Once he saw the data, he agreed that using S3 was a better option. We implemented it, and the API became much faster.
The conflict was resolved simply because we focused on facts, tested both options, and chose what was best for the product.

## Q18.“How do you stay calm under pressure?”

stay calm under pressure by focusing on the facts. 
When something breaks, I check the logs, understand the impact, and prioritize what needs attention first. 
I take a moment to think before acting, which helps avoid mistakes, and I communicate clearly so everyone knows the status. 
This approach keeps me steady during production issues.

## Q19. Where do you see yourself in 2–3 years?

In the next 2–3 years, I see myself becoming a stronger backend engineer who deeply understands the product and its architecture. I want to be someone the team can rely on for complex debugging, stability, and improving system performance.

I also see myself taking more ownership — not just fixing issues, but preventing them, improving processes, and contributing to technical decisions.

Most importantly, I want to grow with the product here. As Delightree scales, I want to be part of the core team that supports that growth and keeps the system stable
