## 🎯 **Mono Solutions – Client Interview (Mock Script)**

*(Approx. 15 minutes total)*

---

### 👋 **1. Greeting & Small Talk (1–2 min)**

**Interviewer (Christian):**
Hi Vaibhav, how are you doing today?

**You:**
I’m doing great, thank you! Excited to speak with you today. How are you doing?

**Interviewer:**
I’m good, thanks. So, where are you joining from?

**You:**
I’m joining from India — currently based in [your city].

**Interviewer:**
Ah, nice! How’s the weather there?

**You:**
It’s actually quite pleasant today — not too hot. How’s it in Denmark?

**Interviewer (smiles):**
Cold as always! Alright, let’s get started.

---

### 💬 **2. Tell Me About Yourself (2 min)**

**Interviewer:**
Can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you’ve been working on recently?

**You:**
Sure. Hi, I’m Vaibhav Raj, a backend developer with around four years of experience working mainly with Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

I started my career at KnowledgeHut, which later merged with upGrad, where I worked on backend systems, microservices, and features like rule engines, Redis caching, and learner progress tracking.

Currently, I’m with ConvertEdge Tech, helping build an EdTech platform focused on scalable API design, database optimization, and integrations such as Zoom and payment systems.

What drives me is solving real problems and building systems that are scalable and high-performing.

---

### ⚙️ **3. Technical Discussion (6–7 min)**

**Interviewer:**
That’s good. Can you tell me about one of your favorite projects?

**You:**
Sure. At upGrad, I built a rule engine for automated emails — it allowed marketing teams to trigger personalized notifications dynamically. I also implemented Redis caching, which reduced response times by nearly 40%. It was a great experience improving both performance and scalability.

---

**Interviewer:**
Nice. Could you explain what middleware is in Express?

**You:**
Middleware is a function that runs before your route handler. It’s commonly used for logging, authentication, validation, and error handling. It helps structure the code and keep logic modular.

---

**Interviewer:**
What’s the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?

**You:**
Synchronous code executes one line at a time and blocks the next task until it’s finished. Asynchronous code, like Promises or async/await, allows Node.js to handle multiple operations efficiently without blocking the event loop.

---

**Interviewer:**
And how do you handle errors in async functions?

**You:**
I use try-catch blocks inside async/await functions and also have a centralized error-handling middleware in Express, so all errors are handled consistently.

---

**Interviewer:**
What’s one thing you always focus on when designing APIs?

**You:**
Consistency and scalability. I make sure endpoints are structured properly, use proper status codes, and handle validations at both the route and schema levels. Also, I ensure performance by using indexing and caching where needed.

---

**Interviewer:**
How do you ensure security in your APIs?

**You:**
I use HTTPS, JWT-based authentication, input validation, CORS control, and keep all secrets in environment variables. I also perform regular dependency checks for vulnerabilities.

---

### 💡 **4. Communication & Team Fit (4 min)**

**Interviewer:**
How do you usually collaborate with your team, especially across different time zones?

**You:**
I use async communication tools like Slack and Jira, and always keep updates clear and concise. I respect time differences and plan ahead for reviews or meetings so collaboration stays smooth.

---

**Interviewer:**
What do you do if you face a blocker or technical challenge?

**You:**
I start by debugging and isolating the issue. If it’s still unclear, I research possible fixes or discuss with teammates. I believe in asking early rather than getting stuck, and I always document the final solution.

---

**Interviewer:**
How do you handle feedback or code reviews?

**You:**
I see feedback as a chance to improve. I review it objectively, make changes when needed, and sometimes discuss if I have a different perspective — but always respectfully.

---

**Interviewer:**
What motivates you at work?

**You:**
Building something that people actually use and seeing performance improvements. I like solving backend challenges that make systems faster and more reliable.

---

### ❓ **5. Your Questions (1–2 min)**

**Interviewer:**
Do you have any questions for us, Vaibhav?

**You:**
Yes, I’d love to know more about the current tech stack at Mono Solutions and what kind of projects your Node.js team is focusing on.

Also, how is collaboration structured between your Denmark team and offshore developers?

---

### 🙌 **6. Closing (Final 1 min)**

**Interviewer:**
Good questions. Thanks for your time, Vaibhav — it was nice speaking with you.

**You:**
Thank you as well! It was great speaking with you and learning more about your work at Mono Solutions. I really appreciate the opportunity and look forward to hearing from you.
