Perfect 👍 Let’s create a **sample opening conversation** — exactly how your **client interview** with *Christian Leth Jeppesen* or *KD (Mono Solutions)* might start.

The goal: help you sound **natural, confident, and friendly**, even if they have a slight Danish accent.
Below is a full example you can **practice word-for-word** — with natural flow and pauses.

## 🗣️ **Sample Opening Conversation**

**Interviewer (Christian):**
Hi Vaibhav, how are you doing today?

**You:**
I’m doing great, thank you! Excited to speak with you today. How are you doing?

---

**Interviewer:**
I’m good, thanks. So, where are you joining from?

**You:**
I’m joining from India — currently based in [your city, e.g., Bangalore].

**Interviewer:**
Oh nice, how’s the weather there?

**You (smile lightly):**
It’s pretty good actually — not too hot today, so can’t complain! How’s it there in Denmark?

**(Tip:** This small line shows friendliness and confidence without being too casual.)

---

**Interviewer:**
That’s good to hear! So, before we start, could you tell us a bit about yourself?

**You:**
Sure. *Hi, I’m Vaibhav Raj, a backend developer with around four years of experience working mainly with Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB.*
*(Then continue with your 40-second intro we finalized earlier.)*

---

**Interviewer:**
Thanks, Vaibhav. Sounds good. Could you tell me about one of the projects you’re most proud of?

**You:**
Sure. One project I really enjoyed was at upGrad, where I built a rule engine for automated emails and added Redis caching to improve performance. It was challenging but rewarding because it helped scale the platform to thousands of learners.

---

**Interviewer:**
That’s interesting. What would you say are your strongest areas technically?

**You:**
My strengths are backend architecture, API design, and performance optimization. I focus on writing clean, modular code and making sure systems can scale efficiently.

---

**Interviewer:**
Okay, great. And how do you usually communicate or collaborate with international teams?

**You:**
I make sure to keep my updates clear and concise — mostly through async communication like Slack or Jira. I’m also flexible with time zones when needed and always keep communication transparent.

---

**Interviewer:**
That’s great. Do you have any questions for us?

**You:**
Yes, I’d love to know more about the current tech stack at Mono Solutions and what kind of projects your Node.js team is working on.

---

**Interviewer:**
We can talk about that. Anything else you’d like to add?

**You:**
That’s all from my side. It was great speaking with you — thank you for your time and this opportunity.

## ✅ **Tone & Delivery Tips**

* Smile when you greet them — it instantly builds warmth.
* Speak **slightly slower** than usual — it helps with clarity (especially with international accents).
* Don’t worry if you miss a word — stay calm and use phrases like:

  > “Sorry, could you please repeat that?”
  > “Just to confirm, you mean…?”
* End on a **positive and thankful note** — it leaves a lasting impression.

Would you like me to make a **mock interview script (Q&A)** covering the **entire 15 minutes** — including both technical and communication parts — so you can **practice the full conversation** before your actual round?
