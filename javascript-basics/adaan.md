### 🗣️ Common Questions + Crisp Sample Answers

**1. Tell me about yourself.**

> “Hi, I’m Vaibhav Raj, a backend developer with around four years of experience working mainly with Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

I started my career at KnowledgeHut, which later merged with upGrad, where I worked on microservices, performance improvements, and features like rule engines, Redis caching, and learner progress tracking.

Currently, I’m with ConvertEdge Tech, helping build an EdTech platform where I focus on API design, database optimization, and integrations such as Zoom and payment systems.

I enjoy solving real problems, optimizing performance, and building scalable systems that deliver a great user experience.

That’s a quick overview about me. I’m excited to learn more about your team and the work at Mono Solutions”

**3. What’s the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

> “Synchronous code blocks execution line by line; asynchronous code lets other tasks run while waiting for I/O, which keeps Node.js fast and responsive.”

**4. Explain the event loop simply.**

> “It’s the mechanism that lets Node.js handle many requests at once by queuing callbacks and running them when resources are free.”

**5. How do you handle errors in async functions?**

> “By using try-catch inside async/await, or .catch() for promises, plus centralized error middleware in Express for consistent responses.”

**6. How do you improve Node.js app performance?**

> “Use async operations, caching, connection pooling, compression, and avoid blocking the event loop. Also, monitor performance with tools like PM2 or New Relic.”

**7. Explain middleware in Express.**

> “Functions that run before the main route handler — used for logging, authentication, validation, or error handling.”

**8. How do you secure an API?**

> “Use HTTPS, JWT for auth, input validation, rate limiting, CORS control, and environment variables for secrets.”

**9. How do you manage environment variables?**

> “With dotenv files or environment config on the server, keeping secrets out of the codebase.”

**10. What databases have you used with Node.js?**

> “Mainly MongoDB with Mongoose, and some MySQL using Sequelize for ORM.”

### 🤝 Communication / Soft Skills

**11. How do you handle tight deadlines?**

> “I prioritize tasks, communicate blockers early, and stay focused on delivering core features first.”

**12. What if you disagree with a teammate?**

> “I share my reasoning calmly, listen to theirs, and aim for what best fits project goals — not ego.”

**13. How do you work with international teams?**

> “I keep updates clear, use async communication (Slack/Jira), and respect time zones.”

**14. Why do you want to work with Mono Solutions?**

> “I like how Mono focuses on scalable web solutions for global clients — it aligns with my interest in clean, modern web development and working in a collaborative, international setup.”

**15. What do you do when stuck on a technical issue?**

> “First debug systematically, then research or discuss with peers. I make sure to document the solution for future reference.”

**16. How do you ensure code quality?**

> “Use ESLint, write modular code, unit tests with Jest, and peer reviews.”
