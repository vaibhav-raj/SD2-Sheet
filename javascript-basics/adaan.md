### 🗣️ Common Questions + Crisp Sample Answers

**1. Tell me about yourself.**

> “Hi, I’m Vaibhav Raj, a backend developer with around four years of experience working mainly with Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

I started my career at KnowledgeHut, which later merged with upGrad, where I worked on microservices, performance improvements, and features like rule engines, Redis caching, and learner progress tracking.

Currently, I’m with ConvertEdge Tech, helping build an EdTech platform where I focus on API design, database optimization, and integrations such as Zoom and payment systems.

I enjoy solving real problems, optimizing performance, and building scalable systems that deliver a great user experience.

That’s a quick overview about me. I’m excited to learn more about your team and the work at Mono Solutions”

**3. What’s the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

> “Synchronous code blocks execution line by line; asynchronous code lets other tasks run while waiting for I/O, which keeps Node.js fast and responsive.”

**4. Explain the event loop simply.**

> “It’s the mechanism that lets Node.js handle many requests at once by queuing callbacks and running them when resources are free.”

**5. How do you handle errors in async functions?**

> “By using try-catch inside async/await, or .catch() for promises, plus centralized error middleware in Express for consistent responses.”

**6. How do you improve Node.js app performance?**

> “Use async operations, caching, connection pooling, compression, and avoid blocking the event loop. Also, monitor performance with tools like PM2 or New Relic.”

**7. Explain middleware in Express.**

> “Functions that run before the main route handler — used for logging, authentication, validation, or error handling.”

**8. How do you secure an API?**

> “Use HTTPS, JWT for auth, input validation, rate limiting, CORS control, and environment variables for secrets.”

**9. How do you manage environment variables?**

> “With dotenv files or environment config on the server, keeping secrets out of the codebase.”

**10. What databases have you used with Node.js?**

> “Mainly MongoDB with Mongoose, and some MySQL using Sequelize for ORM.”

### 🤝 Communication / Soft Skills

**11. How do you handle tight deadlines?**

> “I prioritize tasks, communicate blockers early, and stay focused on delivering core features first.”

**12. What if you disagree with a teammate?**

> “I share my reasoning calmly, listen to theirs, and aim for what best fits project goals — not ego.”

**13. How do you work with international teams?**

> “I keep updates clear, use async communication (Slack/Jira), and respect time zones.”

**14. Why do you want to work with Mono Solutions?**

> “I like how Mono focuses on scalable web solutions for global clients — it aligns with my interest in clean, modern web development and working in a collaborative, international setup.”

**15. What do you do when stuck on a technical issue?**

> “First debug systematically, then research or discuss with peers. I make sure to document the solution for future reference.”

**16. How do you ensure code quality?**

> “Use ESLint, write modular code, unit tests with Jest, and peer reviews.”

## How do you cope with pressure?

I handle pressure by staying organized and focusing on what matters most. I break complex tasks into smaller steps and communicate clearly with my team, so things stay on track even in tight deadlines

## How was your relationship with your past managers?

I’ve had good experiences with my managers. I believe in open communication and taking feedback constructively. I always try to align with their expectations and deliver my best.

Working with different managers has really helped me grow — both technically and professionally


## How did you tell a potential candidate they didn't get the job?
I believe in being honest but respectful. I thank the candidate for their time, explain that we’ve chosen someone who’s a better fit for this role, and, when appropriate, share constructive feedback so they can improve in future opportunities.

## What did you do when a qualified candidate rejected your job offer?
When a qualified candidate rejects an offer, I first try to understand the reason behind their decision — whether it’s about compensation, role clarity, timing, or another offer.

I always keep the conversation respectful and positive. If possible, I address their concerns or discuss whether any flexibility exists from our side.

Even if they finally decide to go elsewhere, I make sure to leave the door open for future opportunities. A positive interaction ensures they still have a good impression of the company — and sometimes, candidates even return later.

## What’s your daily routine like?
My routine’s pretty simple. I usually start the day by checking tasks and planning what to focus on. Then we have our daily stand-up where I share updates and align with the team.

After that, I dive into development — coding, testing, and code reviews. I like wrapping up the day by noting what’s done and what needs attention tomorrow.

I also try to spend a little time each day learning something new — maybe reading about a new Node.js tool or watching a quick tech video.

## How do you improve application performance?

I focus on both backend efficiency and infrastructure optimization.

At the code level, I make sure to use asynchronous operations, efficient queries, and caching to reduce response time. I also monitor slow endpoints and optimize database indexes where needed.

On the infrastructure side, I use load balancing, connection pooling, and proper resource monitoring. Tools like PM2 or New Relic help me track performance in production and fix bottlenecks early.”


Perfect question, Vaibhav 🙌 — because **this is exactly where most client interviews focus** when they say *“the round will be mostly about communication.”*

They already know your tech skills (from Adaan’s screening).
Now they want to see:
✅ how clearly you speak,
✅ how you handle people/situations,
✅ how you think under pressure, and
✅ whether you’ll be easy to work with.

Here’s a **solid list of the most common behavioral and communication questions** — all tailored for **client rounds** (especially European clients like Mono Solutions).
