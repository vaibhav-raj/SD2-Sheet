## Q8. What is a Security Group?

A **Security Group (SG)** in AWS acts as a **virtual firewall** for your **EC2 instances** to control **inbound and outbound traffic**.

‚úÖ Key Points:
- Operates **at the instance level**, not the subnet level.
- **Stateful** ‚Äì if inbound traffic is allowed, the outbound response is automatically allowed.
- Each instance can be associated with **multiple security groups**.
- **Default behavior:**
  - Inbound traffic ‚Üí **DENIED** (unless allowed).
  - Outbound traffic ‚Üí **ALLOWED** (unless denied).

---

## üîê Inbound and Outbound Rules

### üîπ Inbound Rules
Define traffic **allowed to reach the instance**.

Examples:
- Allow SSH (port 22) from a specific IP.
- Allow HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
- Allow database access (port 3306) only from another security group.

### üîπ Outbound Rules
Define traffic **allowed to leave the instance**.

Examples:
- Allow all outbound traffic (default).
- Restrict instances to communicate only with specific IPs or ports.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Security Groups on EC2 Console

### ‚úÖ Steps:
1. Go to **AWS Management Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Security Groups**.
2. Click **Create Security Group**.
3. Provide **Name**, **Description**, and **VPC**.
4. **Add Inbound Rules**:
   - Select **Type** (SSH, HTTP, Custom TCP, etc.).
   - Set **Port Range**.
   - Define **Source** (IP, CIDR, or another SG).
5. **Add Outbound Rules** (optional).
6. Attach the SG to an EC2 instance at launch or modify later.

---

## üìå What is the Source?

The **Source** defines **who can send traffic** to your instance (for inbound rules).

It can be:
- **IP Address** ‚Üí e.g. `203.0.113.25/32` (single IP)
- **CIDR Range** ‚Üí e.g. `203.0.113.0/24` (range of IPs)
- **Another Security Group** ‚Üí useful for allowing traffic only from specific instances.

---

## üîó Can We Connect Multiple Security Groups to a Single Instance?

‚úÖ **Yes!**  
- An EC2 instance can have **multiple security groups attached**.  
- **All rules are combined (union)** to determine access.  

Example use case:
- One SG for **SSH**, another for **Web traffic**, another for **Database access**.

---

## üìú Example Security Group Setup

| Rule Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source                     | Description                  |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Inbound   | TCP       | 22         | 203.0.113.10/32           | Allow SSH from office IP     |
| Inbound   | TCP       | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow HTTP from anywhere     |
| Inbound   | TCP       | 3306       | sg-0abcd1234efgh5678      | Allow DB access from App SG  |
| Outbound  | All       | All        | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow all outbound traffic   |

## Q11. What is Instance Metadata?

Instance metadata is **a special service provided by cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)** that allows an instance (like a virtual machine or container) to query information about itself.

This information is **retrieved through a metadata service endpoint**, typically available at a fixed IP address (e.g., `169.254.169.254` on AWS).

Metadata is **dynamic**, meaning that some values may change during the lifecycle of the instance (e.g., temporary credentials, dynamic IP assignments).

---

## üìÇ What You Can Find in Instance Metadata?

The exact details vary by cloud provider, but typical metadata includes:

### üîπ Basic Instance Information
- Instance ID  
- Instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`)  
- Hostname  
- Availability zone / region  

### üîπ Networking Information
- Public and private IP addresses  
- MAC addresses  
- Network interface details  

### üîπ Identity and Security
- IAM role attached to the instance (AWS)  
- Temporary security credentials (access keys, tokens)  
- SSH public keys  

### üîπ Storage and Configuration
- Block device mapping  
- Boot time and launch index  
- User-data (custom startup scripts provided at instance launch)  

---

## üíª Accessing Instance Metadata with cURL

Metadata can be accessed **only from inside the instance**, using tools like `curl`.

### Example (AWS EC2):

## üîπ 1. Get a Session Token
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
````

## üîπ 2. List All Metadata Categories

```bash
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

## üîπ 3. Get Specific Metadata

### ‚úÖ Instance ID

```bash
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
```

### ‚úÖ Private IP

```bash
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
```

### ‚úÖ Public IP

```bash
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```

### ‚úÖ AMI ID

```bash
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
```

### ‚úÖ IAM Role Name

```bash
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
```

---

## üîπ 4. Script to Print Key Details

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

for path in instance-id ami-id local-ipv4 public-ipv4 security-groups; do
  echo "$path: $(curl -s -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/$path)"
done
```

üìå **Output Example:**

```
instance-id: i-0abcd1234efgh5678
ami-id: ami-0abcd1234efgh5678
local-ipv4: 172.31.15.104
public-ipv4: 3.91.23.45
security-groups: my-sg-name
```

```

## Q12. What is an Elastic IP?

An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is a **static IPv4 address** in AWS that you can allocate to your account and associate with an **EC2 instance**, **Network Interface (ENI)**, or **NAT Gateway**.  
Unlike the default public IP, which changes if you stop/start an EC2 instance, an Elastic IP stays **persistent** until you release it.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Features
- üîí **Static & Persistent** ‚Äì The IP remains the same even after instance restarts.  
- üì¶ **Account-level Allocation** ‚Äì You own it in your AWS account until you release it.  
- üîÑ **Flexible Reassociation** ‚Äì Can be moved between instances in the same region.  
- ‚ö° **High Availability** ‚Äì Supports failover by remapping to standby instances.  

---

## üìå Why Use an Elastic IP?
### üîπ Problem with Default Public IP
- When you **stop/start** an EC2 instance, its public IPv4 address changes.  
- This breaks **DNS records, API endpoints, or firewall rules**.

### üîπ Solution
‚úÖ Use an Elastic IP to have a **fixed IP address** that remains the same, ensuring reliable connectivity.

---

## üí° Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| üåç **Static IP for Web Apps** | Hosting websites or APIs that need a fixed IP. |
| üõ°Ô∏è **SSH & Firewall Rules** | Admins can whitelist a single static IP. |
| üîÑ **Failover & HA** | Quickly remap the EIP to a standby instance during failures. |
| üîó **Third-party Whitelisting** | For services that require your IP to be whitelisted. |
| üåê **DNS Mapping** | Point domain A-records to a static EIP. |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Know
- üí∞ You **pay for an EIP** if it is **allocated but not associated** with a running instance.  
- üìà Default quota is **5 EIPs per AWS region**.  
- üåç **IPv6 doesn‚Äôt support EIPs** (IPv6 uses static addressing).  

---

## üèÜ Best Practices
‚úÖ Use Elastic IPs **only when required** (prefer Load Balancers when possible).  
‚úÖ **Release unused EIPs** to avoid charges.  
‚úÖ Use **Route 53 domain names** instead of hardcoding IPs.  
‚úÖ For better fault tolerance, **associate EIP with ENI**, not directly with EC2.  

## üì∑ How It Works

```
+-------------------+       +---------------------+
|   Internet User   | <---> | Elastic IP (Static) |
+-------------------+       +---------------------+
                                    |
                                    v
                         +---------------------+
                         |   EC2 Instance      |
                         | (Public/Private IP) |
                         +---------------------+
```



## ‚úÖ Key Takeaway
Elastic IPs are best when you need a static public IPv4 address for EC2 instances.
For scalable solutions, prefer Route 53 (DNS) or Load Balancers instead of relying solely on EIPs.
