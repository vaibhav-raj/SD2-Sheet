## 1. Understanding Traditional Infrastructure Challenges

Traditional computing (on-premise infrastructure) involves maintaining physical servers and data centers. Though widely used in the past, it has several limitations:

### a. High Upfront Costs
- Significant capital investment in hardware, software, and facilities.
- Ongoing costs: maintenance, electricity, cooling.

### b. Scalability Issues
- Hardware must be manually added or removed.
- Risk of over- or under-provisioning.

### c. Limited Flexibility
- Upgrades are time-consuming and require detailed planning.
- Adapting to new demands is slow and inefficient.

### d. Maintenance Burden
- IT staff must handle hardware failures, software updates, and security patches.
- More downtime and slower innovation cycles.

### e. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- Requires duplicate infrastructure for backups and failover.
- Higher risk of data loss if not well-architected.

## 4. Real-Life Example: Traditional vs. Cloud

**Scenario**: An e-commerce company preparing for a seasonal sale.

### üè¢ Traditional Approach:
- Procure and install new servers weeks in advance.
- Potential over-provisioning and high upfront cost.
- Risk of downtime during high traffic.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Approach:
- Use auto-scaling to match incoming demand.
- Only pay for additional resources during the spike.
- Rapid deployment with built-in reliability.

### **Key Benefits**
- ‚ö° **Scalability** ‚Äì Instantly scale resources as needed.
- üí∏ **Cost-Efficiency** ‚Äì Pay only for what you use.
- üöÄ **Performance** ‚Äì Access fast, global infrastructure.
- üîê **Security** ‚Äì Built-in encryption and identity controls.
- üåç **Accessibility** ‚Äì Work from anywhere with internet access.

- **Use Case**: Hosting custom websites or applications.
- **Examples**:
  - AWS EC2
  - Azure Virtual Machines
  - Google Compute Engine

---

### 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides development tools and environments.
  - Users focus on app development, not server management.
- **Use Case**: Building and deploying custom apps.
- **Examples**:
  - Google App Engine
