  - Inbound traffic → **DENIED** (unless allowed).
  - Outbound traffic → **ALLOWED** (unless denied).

---

## 🔐 Inbound and Outbound Rules

### 🔹 Inbound Rules
Define traffic **allowed to reach the instance**.

Examples:
- Allow SSH (port 22) from a specific IP.
- Allow HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
- Allow database access (port 3306) only from another security group.

### 🔹 Outbound Rules
Define traffic **allowed to leave the instance**.

Examples:
- Allow all outbound traffic (default).
- Restrict instances to communicate only with specific IPs or ports.

---

## ⚙️ Configuring Security Groups on EC2 Console

### ✅ Steps:
1. Go to **AWS Management Console → EC2 → Security Groups**.
2. Click **Create Security Group**.
3. Provide **Name**, **Description**, and **VPC**.
4. **Add Inbound Rules**:
   - Select **Type** (SSH, HTTP, Custom TCP, etc.).
   - Set **Port Range**.
   - Define **Source** (IP, CIDR, or another SG).
5. **Add Outbound Rules** (optional).
6. Attach the SG to an EC2 instance at launch or modify later.

---

## 📌 What is the Source?

The **Source** defines **who can send traffic** to your instance (for inbound rules).

It can be:
- **IP Address** → e.g. `203.0.113.25/32` (single IP)
- **CIDR Range** → e.g. `203.0.113.0/24` (range of IPs)
- **Another Security Group** → useful for allowing traffic only from specific instances.

---

## 🔗 Can We Connect Multiple Security Groups to a Single Instance?

✅ **Yes!**  
- An EC2 instance can have **multiple security groups attached**.  
- **All rules are combined (union)** to determine access.  

Example use case:
- One SG for **SSH**, another for **Web traffic**, another for **Database access**.

---

## 📜 Example Security Group Setup

| Rule Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source                     | Description                  |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Inbound   | TCP       | 22         | 203.0.113.10/32           | Allow SSH from office IP     |
| Inbound   | TCP       | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow HTTP from anywhere     |
| Inbound   | TCP       | 3306       | sg-0abcd1234efgh5678      | Allow DB access from App SG  |
| Outbound  | All       | All        | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow all outbound traffic   |

## Q9. AWS Instance Types – Choosing the Right Instance Type

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance types** to run applications in the cloud. Each instance type offers different combinations of **CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity**, enabling you to select the best configuration for your workload.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of AWS instance types and practical advice for **choosing the right instance type** based on your application needs.

---

## 📌 What is an AWS Instance Type?

An **AWS instance type** defines the **hardware specifications** of a virtual server (EC2 instance) in AWS. It determines:

- **vCPUs (virtual CPUs)** – processing power  
- **Memory (RAM)** – available memory for applications  
- **Storage type and capacity** – local SSD (instance store) or EBS volumes  
- **Networking performance** – bandwidth and network features  
- **Pricing model** – On-Demand, Spot, Reserved, or Savings Plans  

AWS categorizes instance types into **families**, each optimized for a specific workload.

---

## 🔹 AWS Instance Type Families

## Q11. What is Instance Metadata?

Instance metadata is **a special service provided by cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)** that allows an instance (like a virtual machine or container) to query information about itself.

This information is **retrieved through a metadata service endpoint**, typically available at a fixed IP address (e.g., `169.254.169.254` on AWS).

Metadata is **dynamic**, meaning that some values may change during the lifecycle of the instance (e.g., temporary credentials, dynamic IP assignments).

---

## 📂 What You Can Find in Instance Metadata?

The exact details vary by cloud provider, but typical metadata includes:

### 🔹 Basic Instance Information
- Instance ID  
- Instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`)  
- Hostname  
- Availability zone / region  

### 🔹 Networking Information
- Public and private IP addresses  
- MAC addresses  
- Network interface details  

### 🔹 Identity and Security
- IAM role attached to the instance (AWS)  
- Temporary security credentials (access keys, tokens)  
- SSH public keys  

### 🔹 Storage and Configuration
- Block device mapping  
- Boot time and launch index  
- User-data (custom startup scripts provided at instance launch)  

---

## 💻 Accessing Instance Metadata with cURL

Metadata can be accessed **only from inside the instance**, using tools like `curl`.

### Example (AWS EC2):

```
# 1. Get a session token
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

# 2. Use the token to query metadata
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```
