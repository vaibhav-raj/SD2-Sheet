## Q. ***What is Nest.js and what are its key features?***

Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript as its primary language and draws inspiration from Angular's architecture and concepts to provide a robust and modular framework for building backend applications. Here are some key features of Nest.js:

1. **Modularity**: Nest.js promotes a modular architecture, allowing you to organize your application into modules containing related components, controllers, services, and providers. Modules encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability and maintainability.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Nest.js uses a dependency injection (DI) system to manage the instantiation and injection of application components. DI simplifies the management of dependencies between components, making your code more modular and testable.

3. **Express.js under the hood**: Nest.js is built on top of Express.js, one of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js. This allows Nest.js to leverage the features and middleware ecosystem of Express while providing additional abstractions and features to enhance developer productivity.

4. **TypeScript support**: Nest.js is written in TypeScript and provides first-class support for TypeScript throughout the framework. TypeScript enables strong typing, better code organization, and improved developer tooling, resulting in more maintainable and scalable applications.

5. **Decorators-based programming**: Nest.js uses decorators extensively to define controllers, services, middleware, routes, and other application components. Decorators provide a declarative way to define and configure components, making the code more readable and expressive.

6. **Built-in HTTP server**: Nest.js provides a built-in HTTP server that can be used to serve HTTP requests and responses. It abstracts away the complexities of setting up and configuring an HTTP server, allowing you to focus on building application logic.

7. **Middleware support**: Nest.js supports middleware, which allows you to intercept and process incoming HTTP requests before they reach the route handlers. Middleware can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and request processing.

8. **WebSockets and GraphQL support**: Nest.js provides built-in support for WebSockets and GraphQL, allowing you to easily build real-time and data-driven applications. It provides modules and utilities for integrating with libraries such as Socket.io and Apollo Server to support these features.

9. **Testing utilities**: Nest.js provides utilities and helpers for writing unit tests and integration tests for your application. It supports testing controllers, services, middleware, and other components using testing frameworks such as Jest.

10. **Community and ecosystem**: Nest.js has a vibrant community and ecosystem with a growing number of plugins, modules, and extensions contributed by the community. These extensions provide additional functionality and integrations with third-party libraries and services, allowing you to extend and customize Nest.js to suit your needs.

Overall, Nest.js offers a modern and opinionated framework for building backend applications in Node.js, with features and abstractions that promote code quality, maintainability, and scalability. Whether you're building RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, microservices, or real-time applications, Nest.js provides a solid foundation for building robust and scalable server-side applications.
